## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

•	The variables/coefficients listed	 below provide the most non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset:
  o	Pr(>|t|) -> Lower number = More non-random
    	Vehicle Weight = 0.0776
    	AWD = 0.1852
    	Spoiler Angle = 0.3069

•	The linear model is effective in predicting the mpg of MechaCar prototypes. Based on the R-squared number, roughly 71.49% of the results generated by this model will be accurate.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

-	Lot 1:
o	The p-value of 1.00 is above the .05 significance level, so I cannot reject the null hypothesis that this lot is statistically different than the population mean.

-	Lot 2:
o	The p-value of .60 is above the .05 significance level, so I cannot reject the null hypothesis that this lot is statistically different than the population mean.

-	Lot 3:
o	The p-value of .04 is less than the .05 significance level, so this lot is statistically similar to the population mean.
