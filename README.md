# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis


## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Deliverable 1

•	The variables/coefficients listed	 below provide the most non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset:
  o	Pr(>|t|) -> Lower number = More non-random
    	Vehicle Weight = 0.0776
    	AWD = 0.1852
    	Spoiler Angle = 0.3069

•	The slope is not zero due to the R-squared equaling .7149 and the p-value being substantially lower than the .05% statistical level of significance.

•	The linear model is effective in predicting the mpg of MechaCar prototypes. Based on the R-squared number, roughly 71.49% of the results generated by this model will be accurate.

•	Since the total summary variance was 62.29 (less than 100), the manufacturing data meets the design specification.

•	The first two lots have variances of .97 and 7.46, so they both meet the design specification, but the third has a variance of 170.28, so it does not.


## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
Deliverable 3

-	Lot 1:
o	The p-value of 1.00 is above the .05 significance level, so I cannot reject the null hypothesis that this lot is statistically different than the population mean.

-	Lot 2:
o	The p-value of .60 is above the .05 significance level, so I cannot reject the null hypothesis that this lot is statistically different than the population mean.

-	Lot 3:
o	The p-value of .04 is less than the .05 significance level, so this lot is statistically similar to the population mean.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
Deliverable 4

o	Null hypothesis: There is no difference between the cost of owning a MechaCar versus a competitor.

o	Alternate hypothesis: There is a difference between the cost of owning a MechaCar versus a competitor.

o	I would use t-tests because it allows me to test across multiple competitors.

o	The data that I would require includes:

	The cost of the vehicle in new condition

	The amount of money spent on each vehicle type over a 5-year ownership period
