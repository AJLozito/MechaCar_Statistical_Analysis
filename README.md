# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

Deliverable 1

•	The variables/coefficients listed	 below provide the most non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset:
  o	Pr(>|t|) -> Lower number = More non-random
    	Vehicle Weight = 0.0776
    	AWD = 0.1852
    	Spoiler Angle = 0.3069

•	The slope is not zero due to the R-squared equaling .7149 and the p-value being substantially lower than the .05% statistical level of significance.

•	The linear model is effective in predicting the mpg of MechaCar prototypes. Based on the R-squared number, roughly 71.49% of the results generated by this model will be accurate.

Since the total summary variance was 62.29 (less than 100), the manufacturing data meets the design specification.

The first two lots have variances of .97 and 7.46, so they both meet the design specification, but the third has a variance of 170.28, so it does not.


I am seeking help on the rest of this project.
