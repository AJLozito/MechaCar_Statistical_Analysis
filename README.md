# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

Deliverable 1

•	The variables/coefficients listed	 below provide the most non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset:
  o	Pr(>|t|) -> Lower number = More non-random
    	Vehicle Weight = 0.0776
    	AWD = 0.1852
    	Spoiler Angle = 0.3069

•	The slope is not zero due to the R-squared equaling .7149 and the p-value being substantially lower than the .05% statistical level of significance.

•	The linear model is effective in predicting the mpg of MechaCar prototypes. Based on the R-squared number, roughly 71.49% of the results generated by this model will be accurate.

I am seeking help on the rest of this project.
